                    <p>Welcome the portfolio of Sarah Rivera, a Computer Graphics Artist with a passion for pixels. My
                        curiosity has given me a wide range of experience in 3D Animation, Graphic Design, and Web
                        Design. You can learn more about my history below or browse my portfolio through the menu
                        above. Thanks for visiting!</p>
                    <h3 class="h3">My story so far...</h3>
                    <p>I started out my career as 3D Graphics Artist at VMAX Technologies in 2008. We were a small team
                        of programmers and artists creating technical simulations and animations for clients in the Oil
                        and Gas industry.</p>
                    <p>After I moved to Houston, I was hired at Cameron International as a 3D Animator/Graphic
                        Designer. I continued to hone my 3D and Graphic Design skills while expanding my experience
                        with ActionScript 3/Flash. I created motion graphics and rendered complex animations of
                        Cameron’s equipment syncing them all to voice and music. I learned to love InDesign there;
                        layout became a sort of zen activity that I still enjoy.</p>

                    <p>When I moved to Austin, I was hired at ITWatchDogs as a Graphic Designer/Marketing Specialist
                        where I learned about marketing from a business /social media point of view. I picked up
                        MailChimp’s custom email scripting and templating, and how different a well-coded email
                        campaign is from a landing page.</p>

                    <p>As a Marketing Artist at Kingsisle Entertainment, I designed and animated kickass graphics for
                        MMO and Mobile games.</p>

                    <p>My current position is at Workplace Answers, which was recently acquired by Everfi. It's a
                        combination of great people and rewarding projects. I couldn't ask for a better place to call
