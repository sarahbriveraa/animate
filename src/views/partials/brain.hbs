                    <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>The parietal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex 
                    in the brain of mammals. The parietal lobe is positioned above the temporal lobe and behind the frontal lobe 
                    and central sulcus.</p>
                    <p>The parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various modalities, including spatial sense and navigation 
                        (proprioception), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just 
                        posterior to the central sulcus in the postcentral gyrus, and the dorsal stream of the visual system. The major 
                        sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature, and pain receptors), relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe.</p>
                    <p>Several areas of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated 
                        as a distorted figure â€“ the cortical homunculus (Latin: "little man") in which the body parts are rendered according 
                        to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule 
                        are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule 
                        leads to hemineglect.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>The brainstem (or brain stem) is the posterior part of the brain, continuous 
                    with the spinal cord. In the human brain the brainstem includes the midbrain, and the pons and medulla oblongata of 
                    the hindbrain. Sometimes the diencephalon, the caudal part of the forebrain, is included.</p>
                    <p>The brainstem provides the main motor and sensory nerve supply to the face and neck via the cranial nerves. Of 
                        the thirteen pairs of cranial nerves, ten pairs (or twelve, if the diencephalon is included in the brainstem) 
                        come from the brainstem. The brainstem is an extremely important part of the brain as the nerve connections of 
                        the motor and sensory systems from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brainstem. 
                        This includes the corticospinal tract (motor), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration 
                        sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).</p>
                    <p>The brainstem also plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and respiratory function. It also 
                        regulates the central nervous system, and is pivotal in maintaining consciousness and regulating the sleep cycle. 
                        The brainstem has many basic functions including heart rate, breathing, sleeping, and eating.</p>

                    <p>This brain is constructed with Blender and rendered with Three.js. The model was exported
                        with
                        the glft exporter and all the lights, camera, and materials are setup with three.js. It
                        uses a
                        cube map for reflections and a directional light for the highlights. There's an ambient
                        light
                        for the fill and secondary colors.</p>
                    <p>With this project, I wanted to revisit my roots in 3D animation and see what I could create
                        utilizing WebGL.</p>
